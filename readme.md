# @matthewp/astro-fastify

An [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) adapter to use in [Astro](https://astro.build/) projects. __@matthewp/astro-fastify__ allows you to use fastify and Astro side-by-side, and deploy your apps to Node.js powered by a battle-tested HTTP server.

Unlike most adapters, __@matthewp/astro-fastify__ also works in *dev mode*.

## install

__@matthewp/astro-fastify__ is needed in production so use `--save`.

```shell
npm install @matthewp/astro-fastify --save
```

## Usage

__@matthewp/astro-fastify__ is used like any other adapter for Astro. Import and use it in your __astro.config.mjs__ file:

```js
import fastify from '@matthewp/astro-fastify';

/** @type {import('astro').AstroUserConfig} */
export default {
  output: 'server',
  adapter: fastify({
    entry: new URL('./api/index.ts', import.meta.url)
  })
};
```

### Options

#### entry

Specifies the entry point to define fastify routes and plugins. This module must export a default function that takes in the Fastify instance, where you can define routes and registry plugins.

__api/index.ts__

```js
import type { DefineFastifyRoutes } from '@matthewp/astro-fastify';

const defineRoutes: DefineFastifyRoutes = (fastify) => {
  fastify.get('/api/todos', function(request, reply) {
    reply.send({
      todos: [
        { label: 'eat lunch' },
        { label: 'exercise' },
        { label: 'walk the dog' }
      ]
    });
  })
};

export default defineRoutes;

// you can optionally configure the fastify server instance, too:
export const defineConfig = (fastifyOptions) => {
  let i = 0;

  fastifyOptions.genReqId = function (req) {
    return i++;
  };

  // for more options, see
  // https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Server/#factory

  return fastifyOptions;
}
```

#### port

Specifies the port to use in production. Most hosts will set `process.env.PORT` and that will be used, so setting this option is unnecessary. If you do set *port* it will override host-specific config.

In development mode this option has no effect, as fastify runs on the same server as Astro.

#### logger

Specifies the Fastify logging options. See the [Fastify docs](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Logging/) to see the options. Note that these options are built into the production bundle, so options such as `logger.stream` do not work.

### Note on route priority

Fastify runs in front of Astro's own routing, which means that any routes you define in fastify take priority over routes defined in Astro. So if, for example, you have conflicting routes the Astro route will never be hit.

### Production usage

__@matthewp/astro-fastify__ automatically configures Astro to build your fastify routes into your production build. Run your build as normal:

```shell
astro build
```

Or if you have an npm script:

```shell
npm run build
```

Which will create an entrypoint for your server, by default `dist/server/entry.mjs`. Running this file in Node.js automatically starts the fastify server:

```shell
node dist/server/entry.mjs
```

Configure your host to run this script. Assets and JavaScript are output to `dist/client/assets/`. You can configure your CDN to serve these files more efficiently and with long-lived cache headers.
